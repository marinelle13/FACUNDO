Hazel and Karol have been my friends since I can remember, standing by me through all the ups and downs. We've shared countless laughs and supported each other as we've grown up together. They're not just friends; they're a constant and significant part of my life story, from childhood to the present day.

In 6th grade, Christine Dorothy started off as an unexpected presence—a bully. However, our journey took an unexpected turn, blossoming into the strongest of friendships. Once we connected, it felt like we'd known each other forever. From navigating the awkward moments of puberty to facing the challenges of life, we've been through it all side by side. Christine isn't just a friend; she's family, like a sister to me. Likewise, I've become a part of her family, and she's a cherished member of mine. Our bond goes beyond friendship; it's a resilient, familial connection that has weathered time and challenges, making us not just friends but integral parts of each other's lives.

My high school journey was made truly memorable by the incredible friendships I forged with Tea, Viel, Jasmine, and Janna. Individually, they are amazing friends, but together, we create a dynamic and supportive group. Throughout high school, we enjoyed countless adventures, exploring malls, cafes, arcades, and more. In their company, I found not only companionship but also a boost in confidence. Although life has led us on different paths, and our schedules have become busier, the hope lingers that we can reunite. I cherish the moments we shared and look forward to the day when we can come together again, rekindle our spark, and continue making lasting memories as the fantastic friends we've always been.

High school was a wild ride, thanks to the fantastic crew – Ella, Julien, Adi, and yours truly! Julien and I hit it off in 8th grade, and she's like a ball of sunshine. Ella, our transferee-seatmate extraordinaire, became an instant friend when we discovered our shared dislike for ketchup. And Adi, the common link introduced by Julien and Ella, seamlessly joined our lively crew. Throughout the hilarious chaos of high school, we've been each other's sounding boards, academic partners, and partners in crime. They're not just friends; they're the reason high school was a blast and why I'm the fabulous me today!

The section I had from grade 9 Solidarity to grade 10 Piety holds a special place in my high school memories. In grade 9, I gained confidence and discovered more about myself, thanks to this fantastic group of classmates, each of whom became my friends in their own unique way. Each individual brought their own uniqueness to the table, and I genuinely appreciate them for it. We were an extra bunch, especially during school events, and the energy was infectious. Just as we were gearing up for more fun in grade 9, the unexpected twist of COVID disrupted our plans. However, the silver lining was that the same set of classmates continued the journey with me in grade 10. The shift to online learning added a new layer to our friendship. Despite the challenges, we navigated the digital landscape together, proving that our bonds were not confined to the physical classroom. Our journey continued, and even in the virtual world, the spirit of togetherness and friendship remained intact, making this section truly special.

Meeting Hazel, Kazandra, Dauran, and Jorge in senior high school has been a game-changer. Our friendship sprouted from a simple project where we were just groupmates, but since then, we've become incredibly close friends. With this fantastic group, life became more vibrant and fun. We share a common drive for academic excellence and set high aspirations in everything we do. Beyond the achievements, we've formed a tight-knit support system. We navigate challenges together, share our problems, and are there for each other through thick and thin. I'm genuinely thrilled to have them in my life; they're like precious gems that have added so much brightness and warmth to my senior high school journey.

Since the start, something clicked between us, and as grade 12 went on, Norriel and I became good friends. In a short time, he became more than just a buddy; he's a key part of my daily life. It's not just a regular friendship; it's like we're part of each other's families. Our hangouts are a mix of fun stuff like playing games, taking lazy naps, and having movie marathons. We've been to different places together, and the idea of more adventures keeps our friendship strong. Even though life and college sometimes pull us in different directions, Norriel remains a big part of my life—a friend I truly appreciate and hold dear.

My senior high school strand has been a significant part of my life, accompanying me from grade 11 to 12. From online interactions to personal connections, they've played a major role in shaping my high school experience. Being with them makes me genuinely happy, and I've come to appreciate and love myself more when surrounded by their positivity. I cherish my friendships with each of them individually, and collectively, they've created an environment where every day is filled with excitement. I don't have a single negative thing to say about them; they are, without a doubt, an incredible group. I genuinely wish the best for each of them, as their happiness and success mean the world to me. I love them so much, and the anticipation of reuniting with them fills me with joy. With them, attending classes is something I look forward to every day, making the journey through senior high school not only educational but also incredibly enjoyable.

Starting college has been really fun, all thanks to my new friends: Jhuls, Norriel, Alexandra, Cyrus, Matthew, and Miguel. Even though we don't have many group photos yet, I'm super grateful to have them as buddies. They're not just classmates; they're the cool people I have lunch with and share lots of laughs. College is way better and more enjoyable with this awesome group. Whether we're working on assignments together or just hanging out during lunch, every day becomes an exciting adventure with Jhuls, Norriel, Alexandra, Cyrus, Matthew, and Miguel. Here's to the beginning of a great friendship and lots more fun ahead!

Being part of BSCS 1A in my first year of college has been a really positive experience. There's a comforting vibe within our section that makes me feel at ease, and I'm grateful for the friendly atmosphere created by my classmates. I'm already quite comfortable around them, but I'm eager to grow even closer and create more memories together. Each person in our class brings something unique to the table, and I genuinely wish to deepen my connections with each of them. As we journey through our academic pursuits, I look forward to building lasting friendships and cherishing the moments we create together throughout our college experience.
