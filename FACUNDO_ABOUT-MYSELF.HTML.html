My name is Marinelle Facundo, and I currently reside under my mom's care in General Trias, Cavite. I am 18 years old, born on October 13, 2004, in Dasmarinas, Cavite City. My parents are Cynthia Castor Facundo and Ruel Facundo, and I am the youngest of six siblings. I also have two beautiful dogs, both of which are currently staying at our condo unit with my siblings back in Cainta. I graduated from Immaculate Conception Academy with a STEM strand, and I am currently a freshman at Cavite State University in Imus, pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

When it comes to describing myself, I would consider myself an ambivert, striking a balance between an introvert and an extrovert. I'm not very talkative unless approached, but I can become a compulsive oversharer when deeply engaged in a conversation. Nevertheless, those who truly know me often describe me as a ray of sunshine. In my leisure time, I enjoy watching TV shows and movies and spending quality time with loved ones.

In Grade 11, I was fortunate to receive "With High Honors" for the 2021-2022 academic year. Continuing into Grade 12, I managed to maintain this achievement and graduated with the same "With High Honors" in the 2022-2023 school year. I also received the Science Wizard Awards for General Biology and Earth Science in 2021-2022. Additionally, I had the honor of winning both Mathinik and Math Trivia during the same year. To my delight, I was recognized with the Siduqua award for my Geometry Painting skills in 2021-2022. <br>

Throughout my high school and college journey, I had the privilege of participating in various student organizations. In Grade 11, I proudly represented the STEM Math club, also contributing as a member of ICARE. My passion for the arts led me to join Theatro, where I remained involved from Grade 11 through 12. In my senior year, I extended my engagement by becoming a member of Penclub. As I transitioned to my first year of college, I continued my involvement in the Clique - BSCS Organization. <br>

Computer science wasn't my initial career choice, and it wasn't a subject I excelled in during high school. I always believed I would end up in a medical or law field, given my strong interest in mathematics, science, and philosophy. I used to be very passionate about understanding the human mind and often found myself analyzing others' thoughts and behaviors. However, life took some unexpected turns, and I made an impulsive decision to pursue a computer science course, despite having no prior experience in the field. I firmly believe that the world is moving towards a technology-driven future, with a high demand for computer-related skills. Therefore, I am fully committed to giving my best effort and adapting to this change. <br>
